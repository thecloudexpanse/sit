This shar file contains the source to "sit" a UNIX utility which produces
Stuffit archives for downloading to the mac.  As a bonus I've also included
"macbinfilt", a filter which takes articles from comp.binaries.mac, puts the
parts in the correct order, and throws out all the "noise" lines.

To use the sit code you need the getopt(3) library routine and the compress(1)
utility, both of which most everyone seems to have by now.

There is not much original code here: everything is reverse engineered from
the unsit utility by Alan Weber.  The updcrc.c file is exactly the same file
from the unsit package.

I've tested the code on both BSD and SYSV machines. Both machines were big
endian so byte order problems may still be lurking.

When you transfer archives to your mac be sure to use "binary" mode.  In 
order for Suffit to recognize your downloaded file it must have a type of
"SIT!".  If your communication program doesn't allow you to specify the type
you'll need to ResEdit it in.  It should be quite simple to modify sit.c
to put a MacBinary header on the archive.

As with everything in the modern world: use at your own risk.
